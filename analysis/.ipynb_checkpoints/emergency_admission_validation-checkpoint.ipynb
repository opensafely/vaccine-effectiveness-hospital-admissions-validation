    "## ECDS emergency care admission vs SUS hospital admission validation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a delay between patients being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and this data being made available.  SUS is the 'gold standard' for COVID-19 hospital admission but is coded 3 weeks after completion of an episode.  This means we cannot rapidly evaluate vaccine effectiveness with respect to reducing hospital admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a large proportion of hospital admission comes through A&E attendance, emergency admission data through ECDS may provide a good enough picture of hospital admission.  Below is a validation of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 are first identified using SUS.\n",
    "* Patients admitted to emergency care due to COVID-19 are identified using the criteria below:\n",
    "    * All patients admitted to A&E AND then discharged to hospital or ICU are selected.\n",
    "    * In these patients, those admitted due to COVID-19 are filtered to include those that\n",
    "        * Are admitted with positive COVID-19 code OR\n",
    "        * Have had positive COVID-19 test in the 2 weeks prior to admission OR\n",
    "        * Have been recorded as COVID-19 positive in primary care 2 weeks prior to admission (primary care positive test, primary care covid code, primary care covid sequalae). \n",
    "* Ability of ECDS data to identify those admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 vs SUS data is assessed.\n"
